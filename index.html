    <h2>What is Eudaemos?</h2>
    <p>Eudaemos, is a play on words, combining “Eudaimonia” and “OS”. Eudaimonia, literally meaning “good spirit”,
      is commonly translated as “happiness” or “welfare.” Eudaemos is a work-in-progress platform designed to give
      a more accessible route to mental health care. Whether you’re in the pits of depression or just want to
      achieve your own human-flourishing, we’re here to provide a helping hand to get you where you want to go.

        Mental health is extremely important and not enough people have access to the tools and treatments to

        with empathy and a novel approach through technology, we strive to help everyone.</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>The Eudaemos framework should not attempt to actively restrict or prevent any specific categories from
        usage. This framework should be accessible to everyone who wants to use it.</p>
      <h3>Empathy and Ethics</h3>
      <p>The framework is designed to be an aid to those who choose to use it, making empathy of the highest importance.
        This data is to be kept secure and private.</p>
      <h3>Precision</h3>
      <p>Accuracy of the system and it’s recommendations. The framework is to assist those who use it in finding
        happiness and managing and responding to emotions.</p>

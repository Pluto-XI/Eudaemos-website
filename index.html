      <h2>What <u>is Eudaemos?</u></h2>
      <p>Eudaemos, is a play on words, combining “Eudaimonia” and “OS”. Eudaimonia, literally meaning “good spirit”,
        is commonly translated as “happiness” or “welfare.” Eudaemos is a work-in-progress platform designed to give
        a more accessible route to mental health care. Whether you’re in the pits of depression or just want to
        achieve your own human-flourishing, we’re here to provide a helping hand to get you where you want to go.

      <p>By keeping track of emotions and behaviors, Eudaemos can promote happiness and well-being over time by
        creating personalized responses to guide you towards flourishing. It keeps track of and analyzes any
        information you give it and responds to it using artificial intelligence. If you’ve been feeling down, or

          you. It finds out what works best, what you respond to, and helps you on your path to happiness. Think
          of it as a friend whos always there for you, no matter what time of day. If you’re interested in finding
          out the specifics and intricacies of the system, head over to our learn more page.</p>

      <h2>The Principles Driving Eudaemos</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Eudaemos was created in response to the inaccessibility of mental health care in the United States.
        Mental health is extremely important and not enough people have access to the tools and treatments to
        help them during their times of need. Our mission is to provide the most accessible mental health care,
        with empathy and a novel approach through technology, we strive to help everyone.</p>
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>The Eudaemos framework should not attempt to actively restrict or prevent any specific categories from
        usage. This framework should be accessible to everyone who wants to use it.</p>
      <h3>Empathy and Ethics</h3>
      <p>The framework is designed to be an aid to those who choose to use it, making empathy of the highest importance.
        This data is to be kept secure and private.</p>
      <h3>Precision</h3>
      <p>Accuracy of the system and it’s recommendations. The framework is to assist those who use it in finding
        happiness and managing and responding to emotions.</p>
      <h3>No Bias or Discrimination</h3>
      <p>The framework, while personalized to each individual, should not produce a bias among different populations,
        such as race, gender, or sex. Designed to be used by everyone, the utmost care will be used to prevent a bias or
        discrimination within our traning materials for our neural networks and machine learning models.</p>

          <h2>What <u>is Eudaemos?</u></h2>
        </a>
        <p>Eudaemos, is a play on words, combining “Eudaimonia” and “OS”. Eudaimonia, literally meaning “good spirit”,
          is commonly translated as “happiness” or “welfare.” Eudaemos is a work-in-progress platform designed to give
          a more accessible route to mental health care. Whether you’re in the pits of depression or just want to
          achieve your own human-flourishing, we’re here to provide a helping hand to get you where you want to go.

          creating personalized responses to guide you towards flourishing. It keeps track of and analyzes any
          information you give it and responds to it using artificial intelligence. If you’ve been feeling down, or

              with empathy and a novel approach through technology, we strive to help everyone.</p>

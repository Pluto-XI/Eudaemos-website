    <h1>Learn more!</h1>
    <p>This page is to hold comprehensive information about the framework and the platform. It will include documentation, developer resources, and technical resources.</p>
    <h1>What is Eudaemos?</h1>
    <p>Eudaemos is a work in progress, happiness engine. It looks at user data, records it, and responds to it accordingly.</p>
    <p>With this system, a user will be able to keep track of habits and emotions and be guided towards happiness.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>This section will contain information about the processes of the framework and how it is constructed.</p>
    <p>It will cover how the engine works, how the neural net is tuned, and how it learns from user input.</p>
    <p>It will go over how the engine becomes personalized to your standards and encourages behavior change through small actions and shifting perspectives by using behavioral economics.</p>
    <p>There will also be a call to action to help contribute ideas and implementations into the platform.</p>
    <p>Contributions will happen through our <a href="community.html" style="color: blue;">community page</a> and our <a style="color: blue;" href="https://github.com/Pluto-XI/Eudaemos-website">website being open sourced</a></p>
    <p>and the platform being close sourced, but available to individuals when certain criteria are met.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Whitepaper</h1>
    <p>The Eudaemos whitepaper will be linked in this section.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Developer resources</h1>
    <p>The implementation of the framework into the platform will be covered here, and a link to the community/contribution page will be put here.</p>
    <p>It will cover everything from the ground up so that any developer interested in contributing will be able to gain the knowledge of the system beforehand.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What is happiness?</h1>
    <p>This section will cover the theories behind Eudaemos and how they interconnect. It will describe the goal of the platform, how it measures happiness, and</p>
